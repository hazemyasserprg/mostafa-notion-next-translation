During this stage, the brain detoxifies protein waste, and cells repair tired tissues.\n    \n3. **Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep (Dreaming)**\n    \n    A phase of intense brain activity, showing electrical patterns similar to wakefulness, though the body experiences partial paralysis to prevent acting out dreams.

        content: "## **First lesson: Rich people don't work to make money**\n\nThe most important lesson in the book is that the rich make money work for them, while the poor and middle class work for money. The poor spend their lives in a never-ending race for salaries and wages, while the wealthy build financial systems that generate continuous income even while they sleep.\n\nThe average person thinks: \"I need a better job with a higher salary,\" while the rich think: \"How can I buy assets that generate income without working?\"\n\n## **Second lesson: The Difference Between Assets and Liabilities**\n\nKiyosaki offers a simplified and revolutionary definition of assets and liabilities:\n\n- **Assets**: Anything that generates income or puts money in your pocket, such as rental properties, stocks, and profitable companies\n- **Liabilities**: Anything that takes money out of your pocket, such as home and auto loans and credit card debt\n\nThe golden rule here: **Buy assets and avoid liabilities**. The trouble is, most people buy things they think are assets that are actually liabilities that are draining their money. For example, the house you live in is not an asset if you pay a monthly instalment on it, but a liability that drains your money.\n\n## **Lesson three: The importance of financial literacy**\n\nThe book emphasizes that financial literacy is more important than academic education. The educational system teaches us reading, writing, and arithmetic, but it doesn't teach us how to handle money or build wealth. This financial ignorance is the cause of many educated people's financial issues.\n\nKiyosaki says: \"It's not how much money you make that matters, it's how much money you keep and how you make it work for you.\"\n\n## **Lesson four: Work for learning, not money**\n\nKiyosaki advises working to gain skills and experience, not just a pay check. Practical financial education and investment skills are more important than academic degrees in the wealth-building journey.\n\nFor example, instead of staying in a secure job with a steady pay check, you can work in sales to learn the art of selling, or in a small business to understand how to run a business.\n\n## **Lesson 5: Understand the power of taxes and corporations**\n\nThe wealthy use corporations to protect their money and minimize taxes in legal ways. The average employee pays taxes on their entire income, while a business owner spends first and then pays taxes on what's left.\n\n## **Lesson six: Overcoming Psychological Barriers**\n\nThe biggest enemy of wealth is **fear and self-doubt**. Fear of losing money keeps people from investing it, and self-doubt keeps them from trying. Wealthy people learn how to deal with fear and turn it into an incentive to learn and grow.",

Start with 10% of your income, even if it's a small amount. This ensures that you build your wealth over time.\n\n## **Diversify your income**\n\nDon't rely solely on your salary. Look for ways to generate additional income: A side project, an investment in dividend-paying stocks, rental property, or even selling your services online.\n\n## **Invest in income-generating assets**\n\nFocus on buying assets that will generate ongoing income. A rental property is better than the one you live in, and dividend-paying stocks are better than stocks that rely on price growth alone.\n\n## **Learn how to use other people's debt**\n\nPoor people use debt to buy liabilities (fancy cars, appliances), and rich people use debt to buy assets (investment properties, buying companies).
